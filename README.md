# AutomobilePackages
When you buy a car, dealers offer add-on packages with features such as upgraded radios, aluminum wheels, and sunroofs. The composition of these packages may be somewhat of a mystery to buyers, and the composition may vary in different geographic regions. For example, in Europe, stricter emission standards, product availability, and local laws might be factors. At the same time, a car manufacturer wants to standardize the names and general content of packages to protect their brand. Assume you are asked to design a software component that assembles the content of two auto packages ("Luxury Bundle" and "Performance Bundle") for three geographic regions (Europe, Asia, North America), relating to two models of cars sold by a single manufacturer.  Design AND CODE the interfaces, abstract classes, and essential concrete classes for this application
